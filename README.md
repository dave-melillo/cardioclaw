# 🫀 CardioClaw

YAML-based heartbeat orchestration for OpenClaw.

> Think [Antfarm](https://antfarm.cool) but specifically for OpenClaw heartbeats and cron jobs.

## Vision

Make OpenClaw's powerful heartbeat/cron system accessible through:
- **YAML configuration** instead of JSON
- **Central dashboard** for all heartbeats across projects
- **Visual timeline** showing scheduled tasks
- **Task orchestration** (Phase 2)

## Status

🚧 **Under Development** - PRD in progress

## Phase 1 Features

1. **YAML → Heartbeat/Cron Translation** - Write YAML, auto-generates OpenClaw-compatible configs
2. **Heartbeat Central** - Background jobs that discover and consolidate heartbeats
3. **Dashboard** - Visual timeline of all scheduled tasks

## Phase 2 Features

- Task orchestration
- Conditional hooks
- Nested heartbeats
